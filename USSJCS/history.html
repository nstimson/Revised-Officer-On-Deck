    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The USS John C. Stennis was established and commissioned in 1995. It has been on 10 major deployment tours. I was onboard the ship in 2005.
     On Ocober 19th, 2005 I went on my first tour. On that tour the Stennis ported into the countries of Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Guam and Japan. 
     My second tour we went to Thailand, Australia, Egypt, China, Bahrain, Baghdad, Malaysia and finally Hawaii. Here is some History that 
     the ship has gone through.

     On March 13, 1991, the keel for the seventh Nimitz-class aircraft carrier John C. Stennis was laid. The ship is named in honor of John Cornelius Stennis of Mississippi who served in the Senate from 1947 to 1989. No previous ships have borne this name.

     On Veteran's Day, November 11, 1993, PCU John C. Stennis was christened at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company with Vice President Albert Gore as the ceremony's principal speaker. Mrs. Margaret Stennis-Womble, daughter of the ship's namesake, also attended as the ship's sponsor. Capt. Robert C. Klosterman assumed command Nov. 15.
